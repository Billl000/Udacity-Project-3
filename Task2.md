#2 Rotated Sorted Array

In this task, I was given a sorted array, and another array that is sorted around a pivot (an element in the array), if found, return the index, if not, return -1
Also, we can assume that the array has no duplicates.

The purpose of this task is to find the index of the pivot of the rotated sorted array.
